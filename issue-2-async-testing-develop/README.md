# Framework for an Imaginary Image Service

This project provides a Cocoa framework to access images of an imaginary image service. It is a playground to develop best practices for building application backends.

The framework consist of:

- an _Model Layer_ defining the (CoreData) model of images, 
- an _API Layer_ providing access to the imaginary service, and
- an _Resource Manager_ tying those two layers together.
